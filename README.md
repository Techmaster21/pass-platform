# Pass Platform

## Inspiration
One time at college I was invited to join in to do some event, I don't remember what,
but the way it worked is you would pay a small fee and then get a pin that you would show
and that's how they would know you had paid your fee. My first thought was gosh that's a lot
of pins, why isn't there some sort of platform for small events like these where you can 
design some sort of virtual pin and handle everything through the smartphone? Thus,
this project was born.

## Purpose
The main purpose of this project at the moment is to give myself a chance to explore the features
of React, Kotlin/JS, Kotlin/JVM, and Gradle. If I end up with a usable product at the end,
all the better.
